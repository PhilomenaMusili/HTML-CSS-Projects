# Registration Form

This is a simple registration form web page built using HTML and CSS. It is a project that I created as part of my learning journey with freeCodeCamp.

## Learning Experience

During the process of creating this registration form, I learned and applied various concepts and skills, including:

- HTML form structure and elements.
- Input validation using HTML attributes and patterns.
- Styling and layout using CSS.
- File uploading in HTML forms.
- Working with different input types, such as text, email, password, radio buttons, checkboxes, and select dropdowns.
- CSS styling techniques, including box model, positioning, and responsive design.
- Linking external CSS stylesheets.
- Basic form validation and error handling.
- Hosting a form submission using the `action` attribute.

This project helped me reinforce my understanding of web development fundamentals and apply them in a practical way.
